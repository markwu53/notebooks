    "* Any module can be a direct summand as a submodule of another module. But the definition asserts an injective module can *only* be a direct summand. In what situation a module is a submodule of another module but not a direct summand? For example, $\\mathbb{Z}_2$ in $\\mathbb{Z}_4$ as $\\mathbb{Z}$-modules. $3\\mathbb{Z}$ in $\\mathbb{Z}$ as $\\mathbb{Z}$-modules. It seems that the submodule in this case is too *coarse*. There are *finer* elements that can *fill* in it to make a larger submodule. This notion can be pursued in two senses.\n",
    "* If all *finer* elements are already contained in a module, makes it a *fully divisable* module, then there is no way to fill it more, any element can only adjoin to it in *other direction*, make it a direct summand inside any module.\n",
    "* If an element can in some setting prevent a module being a direct summand, then adjoining this element to the module to make a larger module can remove the obstruction of the element preventing the module being a direct summand, so the new module is closer to being a direct summand in any setting.\n",
    "* The difficulty in thinking injective module is that the definition is not in a *particular* setting, it is stated in *any* setting.\n",
    "* The difficulty in understanding the third and fourth definition is that, it mixes the easy case with the real case. The easy case is when the submodule is already a direct summand, which we sometimes implicitly think that way. In the easy case, we can simply set the values on the other part of the direct summand to be zero, or freely assign any value on the *generators* of the other part of the direct summand. Removing this easy case, the problem falls back to the real case, which is the same as in other definitions."
