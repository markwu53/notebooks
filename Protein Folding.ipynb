    "1 The Protein Folding Problem\n",
    "\n",
    "Proteins are large polymeric molecules which form the predominate part of all living\n",
    "matter. They are polymers since they are formed by connecting small molecules, from a\n",
    "pool of twenty different types of amino acids, into long flexible linear chains. The twenty\n",
    "amino acids which are used in living organisms vary in size from 7 to 24 atoms, about half\n",
    "of which are Hydrogen atoms. This is what we mean by a small molecule. The only other\n",
    "atoms involved are Carbon, Nitrogen, Oxygen, and Sulfur. From these five types of atoms\n",
    "the amino acids are constructed in the general form:\n",
    "\n",
    "1\n",
    "\n",
    "In the above R stands for what is called the side chain. Each of the twenty amino\n",
    "acids has a different structure in its side chain. These differences give the amino acids a\n",
    "variety of chemical properties in a neutral solution of water. All cells synthesize proteins\n",
    "as long linear chains (consisting of between 50 and 1000 monomers) of the amino acid\n",
    "subunits. Two amino acids can be linked together by attaching the amino group of one to\n",
    "the carboxy group of the other, forming a new Carbon-Nitrogen bond called the peptide\n",
    "bond, with the removal of a water molecule. Thus in a chain of amino acids, there is only\n",
    "one exposed amino terminus and one exposed carboxy terminus. This linear arrangement\n",
    "makes it easier to synthesize polymers with a very specific order of the monomer subunits.\n",
    "After synthesis this long chain is released into the solvent (water), which begins to interact\n",
    "with the side chains according to their properties. This interaction does not involve the\n",
    "formation or breakage of covalent bonds, but does involve formation and breakage of much\n",
    "weaker hydrogen bonds, and other types of weaker chemical interactions. What ensues is\n",
    "a complex folding process where the protein chain forms a compact stable shape, pushing\n",
    "all the water molecules to its exterior. This shape is the active or native conformation of\n",
    "the protein.\n",
    "\n",
    "Proteins can be thought of as little molecular machines, which process other molecules\n",
    "in very specific, repeatable and controllable ways. It is also remarkable that these machines assemble themselves automatically—as we have just described. The shape that the\n",
    "finally assembled protein takes is controlled by the specific sequence of amino acids used\n",
    "to synthesize the protein chain. Hence “machine design” is very compactly coded in the\n",
    "sequence of amino acids. The sequence of amino acids is coded in the DNA sequence of\n",
    "the gene for that protein. Hence if the DNA sequence is mutated, i.e. changed in some\n",
    "way, the resulting protein will be affected. The shape of the protein determines whether or\n",
    "not it will be able to do its job(s) properly. Hence organisms can be understood to evolve\n",
    "by discrete changes in the DNA and amino acid sequences, resulting in differently shaped\n",
    "proteins with different functionalities. The problem for understanding this evolution process in detail is that the code translating an amino acid sequence into an active protein\n",
    "machine is an analog code, implemented by a complicated physical process. If we know\n",
    "the mutated amino acid sequence, but cannot predict the shape of the resulting protein\n",
    "because of the complexity of the folding code, then we are hindered in making a theoretical\n",
    "assessment of the effect of the mutation on the organism. Biologists try to work around\n",
    "this problem by experimental observation of micro-evolutionary changes, where a surprising amount of information about the molecular details can be recovered. However, much\n",
    "macro-evolutionary speculation involves transformations occurring in hypothetical organisms, transformations of a type which have not been observed in the laboratory, nor are\n",
    "they likely to be observed. Organisms are integrated systems operating according to their\n",
    "own internal logic, which possesses a certain degree of plasticity. But the central assertion that organisms can be step-wise modified (through well understood DNA mutational\n",
    "events) so that at each step the organism is viable and competitive in its environment, and\n",
    "such that the overall result is that e.g. procaryotes (i.e. bacteria) evolve into eucaryotes\n",
    "(higher organisms capable of multicellular organization), or other such macro-evolutionary\n",
    "steps, has not been demonstrated. Hence a theoretical and detailed understanding of hypo2\n",
    "thetical macro-evolutionary processes at the molecular level involves breaking the “folding\n",
    "code”.\n",
    "\n",
    "Because of the central role of proteins as the “movers and shakers” of the cell, it is safe\n",
    "to say that many diseases are affected by some protein machine that is not doing its job\n",
    "properly. Most drugs are smaller molecules which attach to some protein and turn it on\n",
    "or off, or change its function in some way. In the past we did not know these details about\n",
    "how particular drugs work, but now this is changing. In the past drugs were found by trial\n",
    "and error. Furthermore these drug molecules have side effects: not only do they affect\n",
    "the problem protein, but they also affect many other good proteins, making them not\n",
    "work as well as before. However if we understand the exact shape of the problem protein,\n",
    "we can design drug molecules which will efficiently affect only the problem protein. This\n",
    "will result in highly effective drugs with no side effects. Thus we need to understand\n",
    "all the proteins in the organism and how they interact with one another. The easiest\n",
    "way to find all the proteins in an organism is to completely sequence all the DNA in\n",
    "that organism’s genome (its chromosomes). For humans this project is called the Human\n",
    "Genome Project. This information will tell us the amino acid sequences of all the proteins.\n",
    "But unless we can break the “folding code” we will not know the shape of the protein\n",
    "determined by a given amino acid sequence, hence we are greatly hindered in carrying out\n",
    "this program. The interactions of proteins in biochemical networks are controlled by many\n",
    "of the same physical interactions which are so important during the folding process. Hence\n",
    "understanding the folding process and being able to predict the folded conformation from\n",
    "the amino acid sequence is a fundamental scientific problem of great biological and medical\n",
    "importance.\n",
    "\n",
    "The “Protein Folding Problem” thus has two parts. The static problem is to predict\n",
    "the active conformation of the protein given only its amino acid sequence. The dynamic\n",
    "problem is to rationalize the folding process as a complex physical interaction. In some\n",
    "sense it is misleading to speak of “the” folded conformation. Many proteins undergo\n",
    "controlled conformational changes as an integral part of their activity, like a machine with\n",
    "moving parts. Some proteins have regions where the structure is random or amorphous,\n",
    "and yet for some purposes this is a help rather than a hindrance. Thus we wish to set up a\n",
    "mathematical model for a protein molecule in solution that will encompass both the static\n",
    "and dynamic aspects."
