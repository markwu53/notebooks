    "Let $X$ be a set. $P(X)$ is the power set of $X$. $P$ is a contravariant endo-functor on the category $Set$: if $f:X\\to Y$ is a morphisim, $P(f)$ is a morphism from $P(Y)$ to $P(X)$ such that $P(f)(U)=f^{-1}(U)$ where $U$ is an element of $P(Y)$ or a subset of $Y$, and $f^{-1}(U)$ is the inverse image of $U$, which is a subset of $X$, or an element of $P(X)$. A power set is a poset with inclusion as the order relation. $f^{-1}$ is an order preserving function. If we view $P(X)$ and $P(Y)$ as categories, then $f^{-1}$ is a functor."
