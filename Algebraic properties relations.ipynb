If $a$ is not primitive, then there is an unqiue element $r$ in $R$ (up to modulo units) such that $a=rp$ such that $p$ is a primitive polynomial in $R[x]$. Any factorization of $a$ in $R[x]$ will have a factorization of $r$ in $R$. But factorization in $R$ is unique. So to prove the original statement, it suffices to prove it for an primitive element $a$ in $R[x]$.\n",

By Gauss Lemma, any irreducible in $R[x]$ is also irreducible in $F[x]$, so the factorization of $a$ in $R[x]$ is also a factorization in $F[x]$. But $F[x]$ is a principle ideal domain (p.i.d.) and therefore a u.f.d., so the factorization of $a$ in $F[x]$ is unique. Therefore, the two factorization of $a$ in $F[x]$ have to be the same up to fractions in $F$. Consider two factors. They are the same up to a fraction. But they are already primitive (with coefficients in $R$). So the fraction is actually a unit in $R$. So they are the same elements in $R[x]$ (up to a unit in $R$). ///"
