    "Let $A$ be an integral domain. Let $K$ be its field of fraction. Then $K$ is an $A$-module as well as an $A$-algebra. Let $M$ be the set of $A$-submodules of $K$. $M$ has two binary operations: direct sum and tensor product of two submodules. $M$ is like a ring under these two binary operations with addtion being direct sum and multiplication being tensor product: It's a monoid under both operations. The two operations satisfy distribution law. The zero submodule is the addition zero and $A$ itself is the multiplication unit. The group of units of this ring (modulo the subgroup of principal submodules) is called the **class group**."
