The shapes are different for the subsets in different copies of Euclidean spaces. But if we look at the limit, or look at the equivalence class of line segments passing through the corresponding points, where line segments are related with each other by the differerntiable bijection. The collection of such equivalence classes is not a Euclidean space again. It's a vector space. We can define this vector space to be the tangent space at a point.\n",
