The difference is $na_{-1}2\\pi i$, where $n$ is the winding number, the times the concatenation of the two paths wind around the punctured point $p$.

Imagine the path is retractible, and we let the tip of the path gradually move away from $w$ and wrap around $p$ and approaches $w$ from another direction. During this process, the integral value, or $y$, will gradually change from the original $y$ value to $y\\pm a_{-1}2\\pi i$. This shows that for the inverse function $J$ there is a path from $y$ to $y\\pm a_{-1}2\\pi i$ such that the function $J$ is defined along a neighborhood of the path, and the function $J$ has the same value of $w$ at $y$ and $y\\pm a_{-1}2\\pi i$.
